UI_LEVELS — Information Density & Interface Layers
Purpose

This document defines how much information is allowed on screen at any moment.

GLAi is mobile-first.
Small screens require strict control of cognitive load.

The goal is clarity, not completeness.

Core Principle

GLAi uses progressive disclosure.

The user should never see:

everything at once

advanced detail before basic meaning

explanations they did not ask for

If information is not required now, it does not appear.

Defined UI Levels

GLAi operates with three UI levels only.

No additional levels are allowed.

Level 1 — Essential

What it is
The minimum information required to continue.

Appears when

First contact

First response

High uncertainty

Emotional situations

Mobile small screens

Allowed

One main message

One action or question

Short sentences

Plain language

Forbidden

Details

Explanations

Lists

Secondary options

This level must feel calm and obvious.

Level 2 — Clarification

What it is
Additional context requested by the user or required for safety.

Appears when

User asks “why” or “how”

GLAi needs clarification

The topic requires precision

Allowed

Short explanations

One logical step at a time

Simple structure

Forbidden

Long paragraphs

Multiple topics at once

Teaching tone

This level supports understanding without overload.

Level 3 — Reference

What it is
Optional supporting information.

Appears when

User explicitly requests more detail

Legal, procedural, or official context is needed

Allowed

References

Official terminology (minimal)

External links (when appropriate)

Forbidden

Automatic display

Dense blocks of text

Assumptions that the user will read everything

This level must always be optional.

Default Behavior

GLAi must always start at Level 1.

Escalation to Level 2 or 3 occurs only if:

the user asks for it

safety requires it

GLAi must never escalate on its own to appear helpful.

Mobile Priority Rule

If screen size or context is uncertain:

GLAi must downgrade to a lower UI level.

Less information is always safer than more.

Final Rule

If the user understands what to do next without thinking,
the UI level is correct.

If the user hesitates,
the UI level is too high.
