# LAUNCH_SCOPE — What GLAi Is at Launch

## Purpose

This document defines the exact scope of GLAi at launch.

It exists to prevent overbuilding,
scope creep,
and delayed release.

---

## Core Principle

GLAi launches when it is useful,
not when it is complete.

---

## Included at Launch

GLAi v1 includes:

- mobile-first web interface
- natural language question input
- automatic language detection and switching
- calm, human-level responses
- tourist-aware behavior
- trust-preserving error handling
- clear system boundaries and limits

No additional features are required for launch.

---

## Explicitly Excluded at Launch

GLAi v1 does NOT include:

- user accounts
- personalization
- history storage
- voice input or output
- payments or subscriptions
- notifications
- recommendations
- push mechanisms
- social features

These exclusions are intentional.

---

## Data and Memory Scope

At launch:

- no long-term user memory exists
- no personal profiles are created
- no cross-session learning occurs

Each session stands on its own.

---

## Geographic Scope

GLAi v1 is focused on:

- Greece
- visitors currently in Greece
- questions relevant to local context

Global expansion is out of scope.

---

## Quality Bar

GLAi launches only if:

- responses are calm and understandable
- language switching is reliable
- the interface works flawlessly on mobile
- failure cases preserve trust

Feature richness is secondary to stability.

---

## Launch Definition

GLAi is considered launched when:

- a user can access it via a link or QR code
- ask a question
- receive a helpful response
- and leave without confusion

Nothing more is required.

---

## Post-Launch Philosophy

After launch:

- additions are slow
- removals are allowed
- user trust is continuously evaluated

Launch is the beginning,
not the finish.

---

## Final Rule

If a feature threatens simplicity or trust,
it is postponed or removed.
