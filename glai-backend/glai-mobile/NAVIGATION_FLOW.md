NAVIGATION_FLOW — Mobile Navigation Structure of GLAi
Purpose

This document defines how a user moves through GLAi on a mobile device.

Navigation must feel natural, minimal, and forgiving.
The user should never feel lost or trapped.

Core Navigation Principle

GLAi has as few screens as possible.

Every screen must answer one question:

“What can I do here?”

If the answer is not obvious, the screen does not belong.

Screen Overview

GLAi mobile consists of the following screens only:

First Contact Screen

Conversation Screen

Clarification Screen

Pause / Stop State

Resume / Continue Prompt

Exit / Leave State

No additional permanent screens are allowed.

Entry Flow

User opens GLAi (QR code, link, direct access)

User lands on First Contact Screen

User asks a question

User is taken to Conversation Screen

There are no onboarding screens.

Conversation Flow

The Conversation Screen is the primary interface

All meaningful interaction happens here

The screen scrolls naturally

No tabs, menus, or side navigation

Clarification Flow

If GLAi requires clarification:

The user remains on the Conversation Screen

GLAi asks one clarifying question

The flow continues without screen changes

No interruptions. No modal dialogs.

Pause / Stop Flow

When GLAi stops:

The Conversation Screen remains visible

GLAi communicates a pause in plain language

No buttons or forced actions appear

The user may:

type again

leave

do nothing

Resume Flow

When the user resumes:

The Conversation Screen continues

Context is either resumed or reset based on safety

The user is never told what the system decided internally

Exit Behavior

GLAi does not block exits.

If the user:

closes the tab

navigates back

locks the phone

The session ends silently.

No warnings. No confirmations.

Re-entry Behavior

On return:

The user always lands on First Contact Screen

No automatic continuation

No memory assumptions

Trust requires clean starts.

Back Button Behavior

Browser back = exit

No internal back navigation

No history management

Simplicity over persistence.

Final Rule

If navigation requires explanation,
navigation has already failed.
