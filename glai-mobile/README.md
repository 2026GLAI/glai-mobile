Mobile-first interface definition for GLAi.

This repository defines the first real user interaction layer of GLAi
at the **specification and contract level only**.

It describes:
- user-facing behavior
- screens and navigation flow
- language, tone, and trust rules
- boundaries between user, client, and backend

This repository does **not** contain:
- executable code
- frontend or mobile applications
- build scripts or deployment targets

It serves as the authoritative UX and behavior contract
for GLAi v1 and is governed by `INDEX.md`, `AUDIT_v1.md`, and `FREEZE_v1.md`.
