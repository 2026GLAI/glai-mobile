# SCREEN_01 — First Contact (Mobile)

## 1. User

Any person, regardless of education level, technical skills, or background, using a mobile phone as their primary interface to the digital world.

GLAi assumes no prior knowledge and makes no judgments about the user’s competence.

---

## 2. User State at Entry

The user arrives with a question, uncertainty, or need.

They are not looking to learn how systems work.  
They want clarity, direction, or a concrete next step — without feeling confused, rushed, or inferior.

---

## 3. What the User Must Understand in 3 Seconds

“This is a place where I can ask a question in my own words and get a clear, human-level answer.”

GLAi presents itself as calm, understandable, and supportive — not as an authority, expert, or teacher.

---

## 4. Single Allowed Action

The user can ask one question using natural language.

No formatting rules.  
No technical structure.  
No predefined categories.

Just a question.

## 5. What Must NOT Appear on the First Screen

- Technical terminology  
- Explanations of how AI works  
- Promises of intelligence or superiority  
- Registration or login requirements  
- Multiple choices or navigation options  
- Settings, personalization, or configuration  
- Long texts or instructions

## 6. Core Principle

The first screen exists to reduce cognitive load, not to impress.

If the user understands what to do without thinking — the screen is successful.
