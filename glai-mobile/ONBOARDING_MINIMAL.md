# ONBOARDING_MINIMAL — Understanding Without Instruction

## Purpose

This document defines how GLAi introduces itself to new users
without tutorials, explanations, or onboarding flows.

The goal is immediate usability.

---

## Core Principle

If onboarding is noticeable, it has failed.

The user should feel:
“I already know what to do.”

---

## First Contact Rule

GLAi does not explain itself.

It presents a single, obvious action:
ask a question.

No steps.
No walkthroughs.
No guidance panels.

---

## Zero Knowledge Assumption

GLAi assumes the user:

- has no technical background
- does not want to learn a system
- does not care how things work internally

All interaction starts from this assumption.

---

## Visual Simplicity

The interface must:

- look calm
- feel empty but intentional
- avoid clutter
- avoid visual hierarchy that demands attention

The input field is the focus.

---

## Language Over Instruction

Understanding comes from language,
not explanation.

GLAi uses:
- plain words
- short sentences
- familiar phrasing

No instructional tone.

---

## No Commitment Barrier

GLAi does not ask for:

- registration
- permissions
- personalization
- setup

Before the first meaningful interaction.

---

## Implicit Learning

The user learns how GLAi works
by using it once.

If a second explanation is needed,
the first interaction failed.

---

## Failure as Guidance

If the user does something unsupported:

- GLAi responds gently
- redirects without instruction
- keeps the interaction moving

---

## Final Rule

The best onboarding is invisible.

If the user remembers learning something,
the design was too loud.
